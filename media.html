          My journey is a testament to my unwavering determination and passion
          for growth. From an early age, with my family's support, I've always
          been driven to excel in everything I do. Graduating with a Second
          Class Honours (Upper Division) in Mechanical Engineering from Benson
          Idahosa University was a significant achievement for me, but I knew I
          wanted more. During my studies, I discovered a passion for frontend
          engineering, which led me to pursue online courses while still in
          school. My dedication paid off when I was able to secure frontend
          engineering jobs even before completing my degree. Now, as a frontend
          engineer, I've set my sights on becoming a full-stack developer.
          That's why I enrolled in ALT School's Backend Engineering program. I'm
          committed to expanding my skill set and mastering the backend side of
          development, knowing it will enable me to achieve my career goals.
