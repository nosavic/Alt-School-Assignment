        <p class="bio">
          I am a dedicated and passionate engineer, currently enrolled in the
          ALT School, School of Engineering's Backend Engineering program. My
          academic journey began with a Second Class Honours (Upper Division) in
          Mechanical Engineering from Benson Idahosa University, Edo State,
          Benin City. During my university years, I discovered a keen interest
          in frontend engineering, which led me to pursue several online courses
          in the field. This proactive approach enabled me to secure various
          frontend engineering roles even before completing my degree. Now, as a
          frontend engineer, I am committed to expanding my expertise by
          mastering backend engineering, with the ultimate goal of becoming a
          full-stack developer. I am excited to be part of the ALT School
          program, where I am eager to enhance my skills and make meaningful
          contributions to both my field and community.
